# Shopping Habits Predictor with ML
## Project Overview
This project presents a simple machine learning approach to predicting the shopping habits based on age and gender. Trained on a labeled dataset, the model is designed to make predictions for previously unseen demographic combinations. The project is built using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries. 

### Data Sources
The dataset used for model training was created by the author. It includes synthetic entries with age, gender, and corresponding music genre preferences.

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 
  - pandas - Data Analysis
  - sklearn - Model training/testing, prediction and basic visualization
 
### Data Cleaning
As the dataset was synthetically created by the author with a limited number of rows and columns, no additional data cleaning was necessary.

## Machine Learning
### Creating Model
The dataset was splitted into input dataset -- first two columns with age and gender -- and output dataset - that contains prediction. As we don't have input for all ages we are going to ask model to predict shopping habits based on age and gender.  
### Measure Model Accuracy
### Persisting the Model
### Visualizing the Desicion Tree
